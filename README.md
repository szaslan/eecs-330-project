### General Guidelines to Follow While Developing
1. Since this is a mobile app make sure to use the responsive tools that Chrome offers
2. Always work on a separate branch and commit your changes to that branch. When you are ready to merge with master submit a pull request and wait for peer review before making the final merge.
